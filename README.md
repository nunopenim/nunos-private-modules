Nope, you won't get leaks here.

I ain't your mother to tell you not to use these modules, if they were top secret, they would be in a private repo. To be honest, I don't really care if you use them or not.

I won't answer to issues or anything, figure them yourself, it's called private-modules for a reason.

Btw, the modules don't support env, just the classic config.py system. So yeah, good luck.
