Nope, you won't get leaks here.

I am no one to tell you not to use them, tbh I don't really care if you do or not.

I won't answer to issues or anything, figure them yourself, it's called private for a reason.

Btw, the modules don't support env, just the classic config.py system. So yeah, good luck.
